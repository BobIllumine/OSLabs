The aging algorithm is based on temporal locality - it means that pages used in the last instructions will be most likely referenced again.
In high ratio sequence numbers are occurring in the short interval, the algorithm stores the most recent elements. This leads to high hit/miss ratio.
In low ratio sequence numbers are different or repeating in a long interval (greater than the number of pages), algorithm has to swap a lot. This leads to low hit/miss ratio.
